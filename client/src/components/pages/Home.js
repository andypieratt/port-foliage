        Hi, my name is Andrew (Andy) Pieratt. In May of 2021 graduated from the
        University of Colorado - Denver with a Bachelor's Degree in Music
        Business. In 2022, I decided to pursue a certification from The
        University of Denver for Coding and Full-Stack Web Development to add to
        my repetoir of skills. Please navigate to the "Projects" section to view
        some of my favorite works!
      </p>
      <p>
        I am a very creative person and I try to add that creativity to all of
        the works I create. I am a Rock/Heavy Metal drummer and I love to spend
        most of my free-time practicing and creating music. Whatever time I have
        left, I spend collecting and sourcing vintage clothing and furniture.
